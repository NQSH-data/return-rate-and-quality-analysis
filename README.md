📦 Return Rate & Quality Analysis for E-Commerce
📌 Overview

Product returns significantly reduce profit margins for e-commerce businesses. This project analyzes transactional sales data to identify return patterns, high-risk products, and operational issues that lead to increased returns. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to reduce return rates and improve overall profitability.

E-commerce brands often struggle to understand:

Which product categories have the highest return rates

Whether discounts increase return likelihood
